# Postmortem: Service Outage on August 12, 2024

#### Issue Summary


Duration: The outage occurred on August 12, 2024, from 08:30 AM to 09:15 AM UTC, lasting a total of 45 minutes.

Impact: The service outage affected the primary API responsible for processing user transactions. During this period, approximately 70% of users experienced significant delays, with transaction processing times increasing by up to 300%. Around 20% of users were unable to complete transactions, leading to a spike in customer complaints and a temporary loss of service for a substantial portion of our user base.

Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in the load balancer, which led to uneven traffic distribution across the application servers. This resulted in server overloads and subsequent delays and failures in processing user requests.

# Timeline
* 08:30 AM UTC: Issue detected by automated monitoring alerts indicating a sharp increase in API response times and error rates.
* 08:32 AM UTC: The on-call engineer reviewed the monitoring dashboard and identified that the issue was affecting a large percentage of users.
* 08:35 AM UTC: Initial investigation focused on database performance, suspecting a potential bottleneck.
* 08:40 AM UTC: Database performance was ruled out as the issue; the focus shifted to network latency and server health.
* 08:45 AM UTC: Escalation to the DevOps team after identifying uneven CPU utilization across application servers.
* 08:50 AM UTC: DevOps team identified a potential misconfiguration in the load balancer.
* 08:55 AM UTC: Misleading debugging paths included checking the CDN and external API dependencies, which were ruled out after further investigation.
* 09:05 AM UTC: The load balancer configuration was corrected, and traffic began to normalize.
* 09:15 AM UTC: Full resolution achieved; services returned to normal operation, and API performance metrics stabilized.

# Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The issue stemmed from a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. Specifically, the round-robin algorithm was improperly configured, leading to uneven distribution of traffic among the application servers. This caused certain servers to become overloaded while others remained underutilized, resulting in slow response times and a high rate of failed transactions.

Resolution: The resolution involved correcting the load balancer configuration to ensure proper traffic distribution. The DevOps team reconfigured the round-robin settings and verified that traffic was evenly distributed across all servers. After the configuration change, the system returned to normal operation, and performance metrics showed significant improvement.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures
#### Improvements

1. Enhanced Load Balancer Configuration Reviews: Implement a more rigorous review process for load balancer configurations to prevent similar issues in the future.
2. Improved Monitoring and Alerting: Expand monitoring to include load balancer traffic distribution metrics, allowing for earlier detection of misconfigurations.
3. Incident Response Training: Conduct training sessions for the engineering team to improve response times and accuracy in identifying root causes during incidents.

#### Tasks
1. Audit Load Balancer Configuration: Perform a full audit of the current load balancer configurations across all environments.
2. Implement Monitoring for Load Balancer Metrics: Set up monitoring and alerts for load balancer traffic distribution and CPU utilization across servers.
3. Run a Load Balancer Configuration Validation Script: Develop and deploy a script to validate load balancer configurations before deployment.
4. Conduct Post-Incident Training: Schedule training for all engineers on the incident and lessons learned, emphasizing the importance of thorough investigation and cross-team collaboration.

This postmortem outlines the key events, root causes, and corrective actions related to the service outage on August 12, 2024. The steps outlined in the corrective and preventative measures section will be implemented to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future.
